## How to Report Violations
Contact a maintainer with the offender account name and description with the offense. Also create an issue ticket with the 'VIOLATION' tag to it.

Maintainers will investigate each and every violation. To avoid exploiting this process, any abusers will be ejected from the program. Maintainers, once after conducting a review, will determine if the offending individual will be ejected or not and will provide a justificaiton for either decision.
