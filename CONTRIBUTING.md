## Coding Style:
We generally accept all styles of coding and scripting, however, to ensure that users and maintainers all understand what pieces of the code does, we require that all functions have a comment block detailing these informations:
  - Author
  - Input (Can be Null)
  - Output (Can be Null)
  - An **EFFECTIVE** description of what it does
**Also***
General coding practices are encouraged, as in no single letter variables, descriptive names, and camel case conventions.

## Testing Requirements:
Every Function will need to pass at least one test function provided by the author to make sure it does what it says it does. And to be added to the main branch, the main program with the incorporated function has to pass all system tests.
